# One-Click Turbo Growth Playbook

This playbook is a practical launch and growth checklist for One-Click Turbo. It is written for a first-time open-source maintainer and focuses on sustainable Marketplace installs and GitHub stars.

## Positioning

Use one consistent sentence everywhere:

> One-Click Turbo is a 30-second VS Code performance health check.

Core promise:

- Scan installed extensions, activation signals, workspace settings, and memory hints.
- Give a clear 0-100 Turbo Score.
- Apply only preview-first safe workspace fixes.
- Stay fully offline with no telemetry.

Avoid claims that cannot be proven:

- Do not promise exact speed gains.
- Do not claim to measure per-extension CPU or memory.
- Do not imply automatic extension disabling.

## Pre-Launch Checklist

- GitHub About description is filled.
- GitHub website points to the Marketplace page.
- GitHub topics are configured.
- Social Preview image is uploaded.
- README first screen has install, GitHub, and issue links.
- Marketplace icon is visible at small size.
- At least one screenshot or GIF is ready.
- `npm run compile` passes.
- `npm test` passes.
- `npm run test:vscode` passes.
- `npm run package:vsix` creates `dist/turbo-vscode-1.0.0.vsix`.
- A clean VS Code profile can install and run the VSIX.
