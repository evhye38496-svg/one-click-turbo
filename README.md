## Why Do You Need It?

After installing too many VS Code extensions, startup can slow down, saving can stutter, and search can feel sluggish.
Most of the time, you do not even know which extension or setting is dragging things down.

Turbo helps you:

- 🧪 **Scan in one click** across extension inventory, activation events, workspace settings, and memory hints
- 📊 **Turbo Score** from 0 to 100 at a glance
- 🔧 **Fix safely in one click** with preview-first workspace settings changes
- ↩️ **Undo every fix** written by Turbo
- 📄 **Export Markdown reports** for team sharing
- 🔒 **Stay fully offline** with no data uploads

One-Click Turbo is for developers who have installed many VS Code extensions and want a local, preview-first way to understand what might be slowing their workspace down.

### Turbo Score Dashboard

Run a full scan to review your VS Code performance health score, extension inventory, activation signals, workspace configuration hints, and environment stats.

### Quick Extension Audit

Use Quick Audit when you want an extension-focused review without workspace configuration and environment checks.

## Safety Boundaries

One-Click Turbo is offline. It does not fetch remote databases, upload telemetry, read source file contents, disable extensions, uninstall extensions, or modify `.vscode/extensions.json`.

The only settings V1.0 can write are project-scoped settings, and only after explicit user confirmation:

- `files.watcherExclude`
- `search.exclude`
- `search.followSymlinks`

Single-root workspaces use Workspace scope. Multi-root workspaces use Workspace Folder scope for each selected folder. Turbo does not write User settings.

If a target folder appears to be inside a Git repository, Turbo warns before applying safe fixes because `.vscode/settings.json` may be committed.

## Purge Behavior

`Turbo: Purge & Prepare for Uninstall` clears only Turbo-owned saved state and recent UI report data. It does not modify settings, uninstall extensions, delete files, or change `.vscode/extensions.json`.

## Install the VSIX

After packaging, install the generated VSIX from VS Code:

1. Open the Command Palette.
2. Run `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`.
3. Select `dist/turbo-vscode-1.0.0.vsix`.

You can also install from a terminal:

```powershell
code --install-extension dist/turbo-vscode-1.0.0.vsix
```

## Development

Install dependencies once:

```powershell
npm install
```

Run checks:

```powershell
npm run compile
npm test
npm run test:vscode
```

Use the **Run Extension** launch configuration in VS Code to open an Extension Development Host. In that host window, the left Activity Bar shows the **One-Click Turbo** entry with a compact launcher-style Dashboard view.

## Package a VSIX

```powershell
npm run package:vsix
```

This writes:

```text
dist/turbo-vscode-1.0.0.vsix
```

## Release Checklist

- Run `npm run compile`.
- Run `npm test`.
- Run `npm run test:vscode`.
